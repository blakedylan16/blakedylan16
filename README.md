Hi!

My name is Dylan Blake. I am currently in NYU Tandon School of Engineering. I like to code.

I'm interested in Game Dev. and Machine Learning.

I have been coding for about 6 years. Right now, I am experimenting w/ C++ and Unity so that I can make a game as a personal project. You can follow my progress through the repo called Flarpy Blorb.

P.S.
If you have cool game dev./machine learning stuff you'd like to share with me, contact me through my email. I would really appreciate it!
