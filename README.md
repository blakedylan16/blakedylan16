Hi!

My name is Dylan Blake. I am currently in NYU Tandon School of Engineering. I like to code.

I'm interested in Game Dev. and Machine Learning.

I am currently mastering Python and learning Swift.
I plan on using Swift to write my first app within the next couple months.

P.S.
If you have cool game dev. stuff you'd like to share with me, contact me through my email. I would really appreciate it!
