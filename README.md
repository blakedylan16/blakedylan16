Hi!

My name is Dylan Blake. I am currently in NYU Tandon School of Engineering. I like to code.

I'm interested in Game Dev. and Machine Learning.

I have been coding with Java for 6 years, Python for 2, and I just started learning Swift. You can track my Swift-learning journey through my public repo called Memorize.

P.S.
If you have cool game dev./machine learning stuff you'd like to share with me, contact me through my email. I would really appreciate it!
